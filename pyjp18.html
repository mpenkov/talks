# Fun with Python and Kanji

## So, let me tell you about [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji)...

Ancient [logographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram) writing system originating from China.

Each character _loosely_ corresponds to a word: 停 - halt, 電 - electric.

Putting multiple Kanji together makes new words: 停電 - power outage, 電停 - tram stop.

Children learn [a thousand Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji) in primary school and [another thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) in high school.

Learning to **recognize**, read, write and pronounce Kanji is difficult.

---

# Kanji Primer

Some simple examples:

<div class="kanji-large">
月　火　水　木　金　土　日
</div>

--

You can _combine_ multiple Kanji together to make a single "complex" Kanji:

<div class="kanji-large">
朋　棚　林　森　明　昌
</div>

--

Knowing the number of strokes in each Kanji is helpful:

<div class="kanji-medium">
ー　九　土　木　本　旭　体　侍　待　倉
</div>

Complex Kanji typically have a higher stroke count.

--

There are thousands of Kanji in use.  How can we ever hope to remember them?!

---

# Getting a Grip on the Kanji

If you can't _say_ it, you can't _use_ it.

How can we refer to these things without becoming fluent in Japanese?

--

We cheat.

We assign _our own English keyword_ to each Kanji.
The keyword _may_ be related to the "meaning" of the Kanji.
We make up _our own story_ to connect the keyword to the Kanji.

<div class="kanji-large">
金 + 失 = 鉄
</div>

--

metal + lose = iron

Example story:

> Iron is an essential metal for the human body, so it is important not to lose too much of it.

The [Heisig System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi): 80% of the time, it works *every* time.

---

# Divide and Conquer

Complex Kanji often consist of simpler _parts_.

<div class="kanji-large">
露　　　雪　雷　電
</div>

<br>

--

<div class="kanji-large">
　雨
<br>
足　各
</div>

--

<div class="kanji-large">
口
</div>

These **parts** get called different things: [部首](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%83%A8%E9%A6%96), [radicals](https://kanjialive.com/214-traditional-kanji-radicals), roots, primitive components...

Some parts can be Kanji themselves.  Others only occur as part of something else.

---

# Questions

1. How do we organize Kanji in a way that's easier to remember?

2. How do we identify Kanji that are similar to each other?

3. How do we break down complex Kanji into simpler parts?

4. How do we look up Kanji that we've never seen before?

5. How do we avoid doing the hard, manual work by ourselves?

# Heisig

Covers **2,042** commonly used Kanji, dividing them into **52** _Lessons_.

Example:

```json
{'#heisignumber': 846,
 'indexordinal': 1626,
 'kanji': '鉄',
 'keyword': 'iron',
 'lessonnumber': 25,
 'strokecount': 13}
```

We can now refer to 2,042 Kanji using an unambiguous English _keyword_.

For other Kanji, we have to improvise, but they are relatively rare.

---

# [KRAD](http://www.edrdg.org/krad/kradinf.html)

One the many useful projects of [Electronic Dictionary Research & Development Group](http://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/index.html).

Decomposes **6,355** Kanji into **254** unique radicals.

Examples:

```
哀 : 衣 口 亠
愛 : 心 爪 冖 夂
旭 : 日 九
梓 : 十 辛 木 立
圧 : 土 厂
```

Example applications:

- Searching for Kanji by radicals (parts)
- Handwriting recognition
- Comparing Kanji

Problems:

- Arbitrary order of radicals
- Does not contain positional information.

---

# Radically Confusing

Example of _different_ Kanji that have exactly the same radicals in different arrangements.

<div class='kanji-large'>
日　木　　　　椙　杲　杳　橸
</div>

--

More examples:

```
含　吟　合　哈
戎　戈　戉　戔
可　司　叮　哥
押　抽　抻
脅　肋　脇
桂　杜　埜
甲　申　由
細　累　縲
詞　訶　謌
```

Luckily, most of these are pretty rare.

---

# [CHISE](http://www.chise.org/ids/index.html)

Covers **20,092** Kanji, decomposing each Kanji into smaller parts using [Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation).

Examples:

<div class="kanji-large">
  鉄 ⿰金失
</div>
(iron = left_right metal lose)

--

<div class="kanji-large">
  嵐 ⿱山風
</div>
(storm = above_below mountain wind)

--

<div class="kanji-large">
  亭 ⿱⿳亠口冖丁
</div>
(pavilion = above_below above_middle_below top-hat mouth roof street)

--

<div></div>

Total of 12 layouts (translingual Unicode characters):

<div class="kanji-large">
  ⿰ ⿱ ⿸ ⿺ ⿵ ⿳ ⿴ ⿹ ⿲ ⿷ ⿻ ⿶
</div>

---

# Encountering the Unknown

Kanji search challenge: look up the characters below in a dictionary of your choice.

<div class="kanji-large">
顳　鸚　爨　驪　纜　鱸　鸛
</div>

--

When you stumble upon Kanji you don't recognize, your options include:

1. Copy-paste into a dictionary (trivial)

--
2. Enter it using the IME (easy)

--
3. Look it up in a Kanji dictionary using the _correct traditional radical_ (tricky)

--
4. Estimate the stroke count, narrow down the results (tedious)

--
5. Enter it via handwriting recognition (tedious)

--
6. Ask a friend (potentially annoying for your Kanji-literate friend)

--
7. Give up.  Pretend that you never saw it and move on with life (unrewarding)

--

Armed with Python and the knowledge from the previous slides, you have more options:

8. If you recognize _any_ of the radicals, look them up via KRAD
9. If you recognize any of the parts, look them up via CHISE

# Let's talk about [Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)

Labeled vs unlabeled graphs

Connected components

Subgraphs

Application of graphs to Kanji visualization

---

# Unlabeled Graph Example

The graph below has 26 *nodes* (vertices, points) and 17 *edges* (arcs, lines).

<center>
  <img src="graph-unlabeled.png" alt="A drawing of an unlabeled graph." width="66%">
</center>

---

# Connected Components

There are 9 *connected components* (clusters, groups) in the graph below.

<center>
  <img src="graph-cc.png" alt="A drawing of an unlabled graph with connected components." width="66%">
</center>

---

# Labeled Graph Example

Each node corresponds to a Kanji.  Edges connect related Kanji.

</center>

---

# [Subgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#subgraph) Example

A subgraph containing only 16 nodes. Helps to visualize graphs with too many nodes/edges.

# Demo Time

Visually identify related Kanji

Study related Kanji together

Reinforce "problematic" Kanji

---

# Conclusion

Stuff we talked about:

- Brief introduction to Kanji
- Kanji resources: Heisig, KRAD, CHISE
- Basic graph theory: nodes, vertices, connected components, subgraphs
- Putting it all together: visualizing Kanji graphs

--

Future work:

- Kanji pronunciation
- Identifying ambiguous keywords
- Application to words (Kanji compounds)
